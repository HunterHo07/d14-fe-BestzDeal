# 🛍️ BestzDeal

![BestzDeal Logo](public/images/logo.svg)

## Summary
BestzDeal is a reverse marketplace where buyers post what they want, and sellers compete to offer the best deals. This flips the traditional e-commerce model, saving buyers time and connecting sellers directly with qualified leads.

## Problem/Opportunity
- ⏱️ Buyers waste time searching and comparing prices
- 🏪 Small/local sellers struggle to find direct leads
- 🔍 Marketplace apps favor big sellers; local options hidden
- 🔄 No reverse marketplace for buyer-driven demand

## Solution
- 📝 Buyer posts product request (name, budget, location, delivery/pickup preference)
- 💰 Verified sellers respond with offers (price, ETA, bonuses)
- ✅ Buyer reviews offers and accepts best deal
- 🔒 Optional: rating, chat, secure payment system

## Phased Rollout
1. **MVP**: Web app for buyers to post, sellers reply manually (no payment system)
2. **Phase 2**: Add chat, auto-matching, seller dashboard, notifications
3. **Phase 3**: Secure in-app payment, delivery tracking, buyer protection
4. **Phase 4**: Mobile app, subscription model for premium sellers, AI deal matcher

## Key Features
- 🔄 Reverse marketplace model
- 🏆 Competitive bidding from sellers
- 📍 Location-based matching
